# Welcome to the RobotBasics Repo
RobotBasics is a work-in-progress library for FTC robots that comes with many useful convineince features, which can save you plenty of time and head-scratching
As mentioned above, this library is still under heavy development, and probably doesn't employ good practices. (I think I'm supposed to have each sub-class in seperate files so I don't have to instance the RobotBasics class)

## Contributing
Contributations to this library are welcome and encouraged. If you want to contribute to resolve an existing issue, please feel free to make a pull request. If you have any ideas that aren't in an issue with the "help wanted" tag, please file an issue, and it will be reviewed.
